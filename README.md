## Overview

This project is a personal endeavor to better understand and summarize the material in "SQL for Data Scientists: A Beginner's Guide for Building Datasets for Analysis". Due to issues with the dataset provided in the book, the data has been modified, resulting in different query results compared to the book.

## Chapters

### Chapter 1: Data Sources and Foundations

This chapter covers the basics of data sources and foundational concepts in SQL. It includes an introduction to databases, types of databases, and basic SQL syntax.

### Chapter 2: The SELECT Statement

This chapter focuses on the `SELECT` statement, which is used to retrieve data from a database. It covers various aspects of the `SELECT` statement, including selecting specific columns, using aliases, and performing calculations.

### Chapter 3: The WHERE Clause

This chapter delves into the `WHERE` clause, which is used to filter data based on specific conditions. It covers comparison operators, logical operators, and pattern matching.

### Chapter 4: CASE Statements

This chapter explains the use of `CASE` statements to perform conditional logic in SQL queries. It includes examples of using `CASE` statements to create new columns and to filter data conditionally.

### Chapter 5: SQL JOINs

This chapter covers SQL `JOIN` operations, which are used to combine data from multiple tables. It includes explanations and examples of different types of joins, such as `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL JOIN`.

### Chapter 6: Aggregating Results for Analysis

This chapter focuses on aggregating data for analysis using SQL. It covers aggregate functions such as `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, and `MAX`, as well as the `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses.

## Modifications

Due to issues with the dataset provided in the book, the data has been modified. As a result, the query results in this repository may differ from those presented in the book. The modifications were made to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the examples and exercises.
