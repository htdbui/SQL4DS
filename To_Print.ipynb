    "# Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are two types of data: structured and unstructured.\n",
    "    - Untructured data is such as text documents or images stored as individual files in a computer's file system.\n",
    "    - Structured data is typically organized into a tabular format, like a spreadsheet or database table containing limited-length text or numeric values.\n",
    "    - Other types of files include CSV text files, JSON retrieved via API, XML in a NoSQL database, Graph databases with special query languages, key-value stores, and so on.\n",
    "- Microsoft Excel is used for creating and maintaining spreadsheets. It also includes some analysis capabilities, such as pivot tables for summarizing spreadsheets and data visualization tools for plotting data points from a spreadsheet. Some functions in Excel can connect data in one spreadsheet to another.\n",
    "- Microsoft Access is a relational database application for creating a true relational database model and defining rules for how the data tables are interconnected.\n",
    "- Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs) are such as Oracle, MySQL, MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Amazon Redshift, IBM DB2, MS Access, SQLite, and Snowflake. The syntax for each can differ slightly, but the general concepts about Structured Query Language (SQL) are consistent across products.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tools for Connecting to Data Sources and Editing SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "- First step is connecting to a database on a server. This is generally done through a SQL Integrated Development Environment (IDE).\n",
    "- The IDE referenced throughout this book is MySQL Workbench Community Edition because in the examples a MySQL database is queried.\n",
    "- We can connect to a database directly from code such as Python or R. For example, search for “R SQL Server” or “Python Redshift”. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Relational Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "- A database table is like a well-defined spreadsheet, with row identifiers and named column headers.\n",
    "- An entity is an object or concept that the table represents and captures data for. For example, in a table of Books, the entity is “Books”. The “Book table” contains information about many books such as ISBN number, title, and author. Some people use the terms entity and table interchangeably.\n",
    "- A row is interchangeably called a record or tuple.\n",
    "- A column header is interchangeably called a field or attribute.\n",
    "- For example, in a table of Books, we can say that “the value in the Author field in the SQL for Data Scientists record in the Books table is ‘Renée M. P. Teate’.” Or, “In the Books table, the row representing the book SQL for Data Scientists contains the value ‘Renée M. P. Teate’ in the Author column.”\n",
    "- A database is a collection of related tables. A database schema stores information about the tables and the relationships between them, defining the structure of the database.\n",
    "- For example, in a doctor's office database, one table contains information about patients such as name, birthdate, and phone number. Another table contains information about appointments such as patient's name, appointment time, reason for the visit, and the name of the doctor. The connection between these two tables could be the patient's name. In reality, a unique identifier would be assigned to each patient, since two people can have the same name.\n",
    "- The relationship between the entities (tables) is called a one-to-many relationship. Each patient only appears in the patient directory table one time but can appear in many appointments in the Appointment table. Database relationships are depicted in an entity-relationship diagram (ERD).\n",
    "![Figure 1.3](Fotos/Chapter1/Fig_1.3.png)\n",
    "- An infinity symbol, “N”, or “crow's feet” on the end of a line connecting two tables indicates that it is the “many” side of a one-to-many relationship.\n",
    "- The primary key in a table is a column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies a row.\n",
    "    - The combination of values in the primary key columns cannot all be NULL (empty). NULL is the absence of any value, a totally empty field. NULLs are treated differently than blanks in SQL. Blank is a single space “ ” in a string field.\n",
    "    - The primary key can be unique values such as a Student ID Card number or can be generated by the database and not carry meaning elsewhere “in real life”.\n",
    "    - The primary key in a table is used to identify the records in other tables that relate to each of its records. When a table's primary key is referenced in another table, it is called a foreign key.\n",
    "- For example, the doctor's office database assign an auto-incrementing integer value to serve as the primary key for each patient record in the Patients table and for each appointment record in the Appointments table. Then, the appointment-tracking table uses the generated Patient ID value to link each appointment to each patient, and the patient's name doesn't even need to be stored in the Appointments table.\n",
    "![Figure 1.4](Fotos/Chapter1/Fig_1.4.png)\n",
    "- Another type of relationship found in RDBMSs is called many-to-many. It's a connection between entities where the records on each side of the relationship can connect to multiple records on the other side. For example, there would be a many-to-many relationship between books and authors, because each author can write multiple books, and each book can have multiple authors. In order to create this relationship in the database, a junction or associative table will be needed to capture the pairs of related rows.\n",
    "![Figure 1.5](Fotos/Chapter1/Fig_1.5.png)\n",
    "- In Figure 1.5, the ISBN, which is the primary key in the Books table, and the Author ID, which is the primary key in the Authors table are both foreign keys in the Books-Authors Junction table. Each pairing of ISBN and Author ID in the junction table would be unique, so the pair of fields is considered a multi-column primary key in the Books-Authors Junction table. By setting up this database relationship so that there are no multiple rows per book in the Books table or multiple authors listed per book in the Authors column of the Books table. We reduce the amount of redundant data stored in the database and clarify how the entities are related in real life.\n",
    "- The idea of not storing redundant data is known as database normalization. In the book database example, we only store each author's full name once, no matter how many books they have written. In the doctor's office example, we don't store a patient's phone number repeatedly in the Appointments table, because it's already stored in the related “patient directory” table, and can be found by connecting the two tables via the Patient ID.\n",
    "    - Normalization reduces the amount of storage space and the complexity of updating data, since each value is stored a minimal number of times.\n",
    "    - Research “relational database design” for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dimensional Data Warehouses\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data warehouses contain data from various sources. They can be designed in a normalized relational database form (as described in the previous section) or other design standards. The data stored can be raw directly extracted from other databases, or summarized, which means it has been processed and transformed. This allows for the creation of analytical datasets that can be stored and referenced for multiple reports. Data warehouses can maintain historical data logs, real-time updated tables, or snapshots of data at a specific points in time.\n",
    "- Data warehouses often use dimensional modeling techniques for their design. One common approach within this technique is the \"star schema.\" In a star schema, the data is divided into two types: facts and dimensions.\n",
    "\t- Fact Table: Contains records with \"metadata\" about an entity and measures (usually numeric values) to track and summarize. For example, a transactional record of an item purchased at a retail store includes the timestamp, store number, order number, customer number, and amount paid.\n",
    "\t- Dimension Table: Contains properties of the entity that can be used to group or \"slice and dice\" the fact records. For example, the store where the purchase was made is a dimension. The store dimension table would include additional information about the store, such as its name.\n",
    "\t- By querying both fact and dimension tables, you can generate summaries, such as total purchases by store.\n",
    "- Transforming a doctor's office database into a star schema involves creating an appointments fact table and separate dimension tables for date and time:\n",
    "\t- Appointments Fact Table: Records each appointment's occurrence, including details like the patient, booking time, reason, doctor, and scheduled time.\n",
    "\t- Date Dimension: Stores properties of each appointment date, such as year, month, and day of the week.\n",
    "\t- Time Dimension: Stores properties of each appointment time, such as hour and minute.\n",
    "\t- This structure allows for easy analysis, such as counting appointments per time period or identifying the highest volume of appointment-booking calls, by grouping the fact data by different dimensions.\n",
    "![Figure 1.6](Fotos/Chapter1/Fig_1.6.png)\n",
    "- Figure 1.6 depicts an example dimensional data warehouse design. Can you see why this design is called a star schema? Schematic illustration of an example dimensional data warehouse design. \n",
    "- In addition to the main appointments fact table, the data warehouse might include an appointment history log. This log records each change made to an appointment.\n",
    "\t- Appointment History Log: Tracks modifications to appointments, such as changes in scheduled time, reassignment to different doctors, and the number of times an appointment was modified.\n",
    "\t- This log allows for detailed analysis of appointment changes, providing insights into scheduling patterns, doctor reassignments, and the frequency of modifications.\n",
    "- In a dimensional model, more information is stored compared to a normalized relational database:\n",
    "\t- Redundancy: Appointment records may appear multiple times in an appointment log table to track changes over time.\n",
    "\t- Date Dimension: Contains a record for every calendar date, even if no appointments are scheduled for those dates. This table might include dates far into the future to facilitate long-term analysis.\n",
    "\t- This approach increases data volume but simplifies querying and analysis by providing a comprehensive view of all relevant data.\n",
    "- When designing a database or data warehouse, a deep understanding of concepts like dimensional modeling and star schemas is essential. However, for querying the database to build analytical datasets, focus on two main aspects:\n",
    "\t- Table Grain: The level of detail in the table, defined by the set of columns that make each row unique.\n",
    "\t- Table Relationships: How tables are related to one another, such as through foreign keys.\n",
    "- With this knowledge, querying a dimensional data warehouse using SQL is similar to querying a relational database. You can use SQL to join tables, filter data, and perform aggregations based on the relationships and grain of the tables.\n",
